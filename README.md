BearBreach is a comprehensive tool designed for cybersecurity professionals. It allows users to leverage public APIs of popular threat intelligence platforms like Virustotal, Aienvault, Polyswarm, OPSWAT and many more. This tool can be used by SOC analysts, Threat Hunters and Incident responders to query an IOC on multiple threat intelligence platforms at once without the hassle of going to different platforms using web and log in into them individually. Here we just have to register on all of these platorms for once and get their public API keys and that's all authentication you need to use these platforms to your benefit.
